### My favorite team sport is basketball
#### It is my favorite team sport because I like being able to dribble a ball around, doing different **tricks**, spinning it on my finger, etc. And it's is always so satisfying sinking a basket. Hearing the swish of the basket after a shot you took is just so **rewarding**, no matter who you are. It also is a great way to practice hand eye coordination because being able to do things unpredictably or without looking is very important in that sport.
