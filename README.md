### My favorite team sport is basketball
#### It is my favorite team sport because I like being able to dribble a ball around, doing different **tricks**, spinning it on my finger, etc. And it's is always so satisfying sinking a basket. Hearing the swish of the basket after a shot you took is just so **rewarding**, no matter who you are. It also is a great way to practice hand eye coordination because being able to do things unpredictably or without looking is very important in that sport.

#Tables
In this section we will be looking at 4 countries I think everyone should visit!

| Country Name | Why I Recommend it | Time to Spend There |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Germany | The country has very important history to how the world currently runs and they have very good deli meats | I would spend from 3 days to a week there |
| Canada | It's not too far from home but still a new area to check out and enjoy. Colder climates for those who enjoy them. | I would spend 3 days to a week here too |
| Italy | There's a large variety of great food options you can try here as well as a big change in architecture (mostly) from the US | I would spend 2 weeks here |
| Anywhere in "Basque" country in Spain/France | Full of people who have a lot of national pride and good food! | I would spend about a week here |
