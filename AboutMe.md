I did just about every sport you can noramally think of until I was at least 12. I went to state 2 years in a row for the 100 butterfly during swim in Missouri.
I had to wait in the hospital waiting room for 3+ hours with a hole the size of a quarter in my chin and thats where the scar comes from.
I also recently just built a new PC that has a 4090 in it.
